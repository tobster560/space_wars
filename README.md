SSC 110 project coded in C with ncurses libary

in lands beyond they speak your name with reverence and regret,
For none could tame out savage soulsyet you the challange met,
Under palest watch you taught we changed based instincts were redeemed,
A world you gave to bug and beast as they had never dreamed.

-From 'Elegy for Hallownest' by Monomon The Teacher
